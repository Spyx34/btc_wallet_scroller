# Crypto_wallet_scroller

## Installation
Installation is really simple, just download the main.py file or copy the code and run it with python3
Don't forget to install the needed libraries, marked at the top in main.py

### Ethereum scroller 
If you want to use the Ethereum scroller, you will have to generate an API key on https://www.etherscan.io/apis first,
and then replace the first line in /ethereum/main.py

## What does it do?
The programm just scrolls through a list of bitcoin or ethereum wallet private keys and generates the public key for each of the scrolled private keys.
It then checks wether the balance on the wallet ist greater than 0 and if so, writes the private key, to acces the funds, into a txt file called yay.

## Stay tuned
There might be this programm, written in c++, coming as well
